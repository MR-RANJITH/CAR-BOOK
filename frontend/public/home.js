      The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car, 
      when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
      Cars became widely available during the 20th century. 
      One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, 
      an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
